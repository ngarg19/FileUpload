# File Upload & Short Link Generator

## Description
Here I built a file upload and short link generation platform. This is a web application built with Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and AJAX. It provides users with the ability to upload files to a server, generate short links for the uploaded files, and enable easy downloading of those files through the generated links. This platform effectively allows users to upload a file to the server, and generate a unique short link that can be shared with others.   Though HTML is enough to create a simple website, it falls a bit short in the design department. So we'll add color, fonts, and element positioning by adding CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to our HTML files to make them visually dynamic. 

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- AJAX

## Prerequisites
Before running this application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Flask package installed. You can install Flask by running the following command:

```bash
pip install flask
```

Run Project
```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage
- Access the server link: http://nikhilg19.pythonanywhere.com/
- On the file upload page, click the "Choose File" button to select a file from your local machine.
- After selecting the file, click the "Upload" button to upload the file to the server.
- Once the file is successfully uploaded, a short link will be generated for the uploaded file.
- You can copy the short link and share it with others.
- To download the file, simply access the short link in a web browser, and the file will start downloading automatically.
